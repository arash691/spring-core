Throughout this tutorial, we will explore the key features of Spring Core and how they can help you build robust and maintainable applications.
We'll start by discussing the basics of Spring Framework and why it's widely used in enterprise applications. 
Then we'll dive into the essential concepts of inversion of control, dependency injection, beans, and bean factories. 
We'll also explore the different types of application contexts and configuration options in Spring.

The next section covers Spring Core annotations and stereotypes. We'll explain the most commonly used annotations like @Component, @Service, @Controller, and @Repository, along with their benefits and best practices. We'll also cover other important annotations like @Autowired, @Value, and @Qualifier.

The following section is dedicated to Spring AOP and covers the fundamental concepts like join points, pointcuts, and advice. We'll also discuss the different types of AOP proxies and how they can be used with Spring Core.

In the Spring Testing section, we'll explore unit testing and integration testing with Spring Core, along with testing using mock objects and test doubles.

Finally,The best practices and common pitfalls section covers common Spring anti-patterns, tips for writing clean and maintainable code, and best practices for testing Spring applications.

## What is Spring?
Spring is a popular open-source application framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring is designed to address the complexity and challenges of enterprise application development by providing an easy-to-use, modular and flexible programming model.

Spring's core philosophy is based on the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI). These principles provide a way to remove the hard-coded dependencies and configurations that traditionally exist in application development. By using IoC and DI, developers can easily manage the dependencies and configurations of their application components, resulting in more flexible, maintainable and testable code.

Spring provides many modules that can be used independently or combined to create a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-level applications. The Spring Core module is the foundation of the Spring Framework and provides the fundamental building blocks for application development. This module includes features such as dependency injection, event handling, resource management, and more.

In addition to the Spring Core module, Spring also provides a wide range of other modules and extensions, including Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, and many others. These modules and extensions provide additional functionality and features for building web applications, microservices, and other types of applications.
